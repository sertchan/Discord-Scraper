# Discord Server Scraper

‚ö† That project uses discord.js selfbot api so the risks you take are your own.

The goal of this simple javascript project is scrapeing users profile pictures, usernames, ids, profile picture urls:

- You can scrape profile pictures on 'webp' | 'png' | 'jpg' | 'jpeg' formats.
- You can reach usernames of all users from txt.
- You could use id's from database. I wrote them.
- Feel free to open issues.

There are plenty of things that could be added to the script, feel free to contribute! üëç
