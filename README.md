  -  You can scrape profile pictures on 'webp' | 'png' | 'jpg' | 'jpeg' formats.
  -  You can reach usernames of all users from txt.
  -  You could use ids from json database.
  -  Bot creates specific folders for guilds so it is really easy to handle.
  -  I used local json database for safety and accessibility.
  -  It is not possiable to rewrite this project with using discord res api due restrictions.

  - 😶‍🌫️ I added all of thing could scaraped as an normal discord user on api. Scraping banners, Bios etc. as a normal user does not allowed in discord.js api. Thanks for patience.

  - 👍🏻 There are plenty of things that could be added to the script, feel free to contribute!
